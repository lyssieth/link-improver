# Link Improver

I'm a person who sends messages, so I made a plugin to make some links better/shorter so I can't
forget :3

## Installation

[![Install in Replugged](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Install%20in%20Replugged-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=none)](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=lyssieth/link-improver&source=github)

## Usage

Just send a link. It'll be converted automagically.

## Configuration

The settings page (which is _extremely_ bad) contains a table with text inputs, and buttons to
add/delete a row.

You can use that to configure it. The defaults come with my pre-made regexes for Twitter and
FurAffinity (i'm a furry, pay me).

## TOOD

- [ ] Figure out an image? What would I even... show?
- [ ] PRETTIER SETTINGS UI
- [ ] More betterness? (idk, i need suggestions)
