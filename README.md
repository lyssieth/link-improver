# Link Improver

I'm a fucker who sends messages, so I made a plugin to make some links better/shorter in case I
forget :3

## Usage

Just send a link. It'll be converted automagically.

## Configuration

The settings page (which is _extremely_ bad) contains a table with text inputs, and buttons to
add/delete a row.

You can use that to configure it. The defaults come with my pre-made regexes for Twitter and
FurAffinity (i'm a furry, pay me).

## TOOD

- [ ] PRETTIER SETTINGS UI
- [ ] More betterness? (idk, give suggestions)
